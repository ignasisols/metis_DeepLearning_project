# Colon cancer detection - Project proposal

Ignasi Sols

#### Question/need:

* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 

I aim to dectect adenocarcinomas (malignant tumors) in histopathological samples of human colon tissue. 

* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
  Patients, doctors, hospitals.

#### Data Description:

I plan to use the Kaggle dataset 'Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images', https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images/code
This dataset includes 25,000 histopathological images with 5 classes - three classes are related to lung cancer and two classes related to colon cancer. 
The images were generated by the dataset authors from an original sample of HIPAA compliant and validated sources (250 benign colon tissue and 250 colon adenocarcinomas) and augmented to 25,000 using the 'Augmentor' package. https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12142v1


#### Tools:

I plan to use the Keras package to build a convolutional neural network model that detects tumors in images of slices of colon tissue.

#### MVP Goal:

* The MVP for this project would be to build a random forests classifier that identifies colon adenocarcinomas.
